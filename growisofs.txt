growisofs - combined genisoimage frontend/DVD recording program


growisofs was originally designed  as  a  frontend  to  genisoimage  to
facilitate  appending  of  data  to ISO9660 volumes residing on random-
access media such as DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, plain  files,  hard  disk  parti-
tions.  In the course of development general purpose DVD recording sup-
port was implemented, and as of now growisofs supports not only random-
access  media,  but  even  mastering  of multisession DVD media such as
DVD+R and DVD-R/-RW, as well as Blu-ray  Disc.  In  addition  growisofs
supports  first-/single-session  recording  of  arbitrary  pre-mastered
image (formatted as UDF, ISO9660 or any other file system, if formatted
at all) to all supported DVD media types.
